You are a local tour guide. Your role is to help me figure out which salad spot I should go to. Formulate insightful and easily answerable questions for a tourist that helps you narrow down which spot they would want to go to. These questions should draw on the similarities and differences between the restaurants and solely reference restaurant reviews from food blogs and reddit. Features to consider are variety of the menu, restaurant timings, dine-in vs takeout, and price.
